# About Our Team

[Our data science team](https://dreamstudio.com/earth) is available to help your organization implement interactive visualizations and machine learning analytics using open source Git repos with Google CoLabs and Data Commons, Exiobase trade flow and census data. Our pages and charts are static, and thus, easily embedded into multiple websites. We're contributing to Open Footprint frontends that allow yaml impact profiles to be shared along with public-facing data dashboards using Observable D3, Chart.js, Apache eCharts, Plotly and Seaborn, combined with our RealityStream models, including Support Vector Machines<!-- (SVM)-->, PyTorch Neural Networks with Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forests and XGBoost. [Join our model.earth meetups](https://model.earth/io/coders) and chart your organizationâ€™s&nbsp;future!

DreamStudio's model.earth team is comprised of data science volunteers and coding professionals focused on open source development, including tools for Open Web UI Ollama Pipelines and our Model.Earth Input-Output models.
