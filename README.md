# About Our Volunteer Team

[Our Data Science Team](https://dreamstudio.com/earth) is comprised of recent computer science graduates, coding volunteers sharpening their skills, and IT professionals focused on open source development. We're&nbsp;available to help your organization implement interactive visualizations, [collaborative partner tools](../inspire/) and machine learning analytics using open source Git repos with Google CoLabs and Data Commons, Exiobase trade flow and census data. Our pages and charts are rendered dynamically from static files (.csv, .json, .yaml), Google Sheets and Azure API calls, and are thus, easily embedded into multiple websites. We're contributing to Open Footprint frontends that allow [product impact profiles](/profile/item/) to be shared along with public-facing data dashboards using Chart.js, D3 and Apache eCharts, combined with our RealityStream ML models, including Support Vector Machines<!-- (SVM)-->, PyTorch Neural Networks with Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forests and XGBoost. [Join&nbsp;our&nbsp;weekly&nbsp;meetups](/io/coders) and chart your&nbsp;future!
